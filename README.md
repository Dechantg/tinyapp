# TinyApp Project:

TinyApp is a full stack project done by myself in my education at Lighthouse Labs' bootcamp program.
It is a simple project that registers users with encrypted cookies and hashed passwords.
The program will store full length URLs and provide shorted versions that can be accessed from a browser at the host/u/[6 character ID]
Users do not have access to other users links. A valid session cookie is required to access the urls
